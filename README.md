# Newmeric
Recognizing numbers thanks to neural network [IN PROCESS]

# Objective

This project is meant to be a challenge in which, from scratch and with the minimum documentation, the whole process of number (ranged from 0 to 9) recognition will be developed in Python using neural networks.

This includes : numbers drawn by hand, neural network training/learning, number recognition testing.

# Drawing numbers

This is the first step of the project. The algorithm should not be trained from numbers drawn by just one or two persons. Hence, the more participates, the more the algorithm will be accurate.

The drawing tool development has just started, as a result it is not functional. However, these options are available --->

- Draw with`ctrl`.
- End drawing with `shift`
- Reset with `mouse left button`

<--- after having launched this script :

```bash
python3 drawnum.py
```

The next step is to enable a `send draw to server` widget.
